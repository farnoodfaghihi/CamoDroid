CamoDroid is an open-source and open-architecture Android application dynamic analysis environment (sandbox) that is resilient against emulator evasion. It is capable of mimicking real devices considering various levels and features. CamoDroid has the following features:

- CamoDroid can mimic actual devices to running applications by cloaking the existence of the analysis environment. It monitors Java and native (C++) APIs that can be used for the identification of Android sandboxes and provides return values similar to those provided by real devices.
- It simulates sensors to running applications and provides sensor reading to running apps.
- CamoDroid mimics the actual user data (by benefiting from a dataset of files that contains various file types).
- It logs the execution of permission-protected API calls made by applications.
- It benefits from an open architecture. Please feel free to contribute!
